**Live Site:** [https://vrnico.github.io/newsletter-setup](https://vrnico.github.io/newsletter-setup)

## What This Is

A complete tutorial site that teaches you how to:
- Store subscribers in a Google Sheet
- Send personalized emails via Gmail (100/day free)
- Create a signup form for your website
- Own your entire newsletter infrastructure

## Why?

Newsletter platforms (Substack, Mailchimp, Beehiiv, etc.) are convenient, but they come with trade-offs:
- Your subscriber list lives on their servers
- They can change pricing, algorithms, or policies anytime
- You're building audience on rented land

This tutorial teaches the plumbing so you have options.

*"Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves."* — Cory Doctorow
